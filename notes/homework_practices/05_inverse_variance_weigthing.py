Imagine a temperature sensor that only works occasionally and sends you the data when it's active. We can simulate this situation by having a fake data and only working with it's samples.

We can show the mean and the variance of these samples in a beautiful `pandas` data frame. It is also going to make it easier for us to work with parameters of the samples.

Here we can also see a column called `weights`, it is calculated by taking the reciprocal of variance ($\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$). We are going to use this weights to calculate the weighted mean, which we expect to yield better results.

As you can see in the results, _grand mean_ is giving us a better result compared to _weighted mean_. This is because we are using the same distribution, or same sensor, for sampling. When we draw samples from the same distribution, since the “uncertainity” of the samples remains the same, there is no point in using the weighted mean.

You may also ask why should we bother with high-variance data if we already have a decent low-variance data. The answer to this question is: **Data is data**, no matter what. In most scenarios, using high-variance data and giving it less weight is much more appropriate methodology than not using it at all.
