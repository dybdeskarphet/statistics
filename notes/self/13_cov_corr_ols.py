## Ordinary Least Squares

When creating an OLS model, we actually build it entirely using covariances and variances. Let's remember the model first:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$

First, let’s define $\beta_1$:

$$
\beta_1 = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)}
$$

The result of this calculation will tell us how much Y changes for every unit change in X. This makes perfect sense when we consider that covariance measures the “rate of joint change.”
"""

slope = cov_XY / np.var(X)
slope

# %% [markdown]
r"""
However, to determine the y-intercept, it is not enough to know the slope; we also need to know the value of Y when X is 0.

To do this, we first swap the variables in our model function: 

$$
\beta_0 = Y - \beta_1 X
$$

Then we substitute $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ for X and Y.
