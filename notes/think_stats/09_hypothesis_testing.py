# Hypothesis Testing

We are going to simulate 250 coin tosses, and try to get an idea of hypothesis testing.

For an experiment where 140 out of 250 coin tosses came up heads, MAD increases. What does it mean? We don't know yet, but we're going to learn it in the next section.

For this chapter, the only important part is to grasp that hypothesis test is a process consists of certain steps.

1. We start with an observation (140H, 110T), and the hypothesis that coin is biased.
2. We choose a test statistic that quanitifes the size of the observed effect. In this example, it's the absolute deviation from the expected outcome.
3. We define a null hypothesis, which is a model based on the assumption that the observed effect is due to chance, in other word, coin is fair.
4. Next, we compute the p-value, which is the probability of seeing the observed effect if the null hypothesis is true.

So we only need: **a test statistic**, **a null hypothesis**, and a **p-value** to formulate a hypothesis test.
